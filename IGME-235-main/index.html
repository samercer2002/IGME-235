    <div id="bio"><p>
        Hello! My name is Silas, and I am a second year Game Design and Development student at RIT. Some of my interests include playing my tuba and other instruments, 
        playing various genres of games from table top RPGs to modern first person shooters, thinking about the in depth technical aspects of software and games (don't ask, I will be able to talk your ear off about some games' technical aspects),
        3D modeling, and I hope to eventually get into more hands on hobbies such as blacksmithing or woodworking. Some of my goals in life include releasing several in depth games, 
        working at Valve, and working on a game engine. Out of this course, I hope to learn front-end web development well enough to make a beautiful and attention grabbing portfolio.
        Of course, I would hope to include some future interactivity of the portfolio including some of my current and/or future projects. Expanding to what I hope to get out of my major, 
        I hope to get some valuable education in regards to coding in a variety of languages, both low level and high, and applying that knowledge to a variety of situations spanning from 
        coding games to shaders, to parts of a game engine. I also hope to learn how to code new tools for pre-existing engines and software. Looking towards my experience at RIT, I hope to 
        make valuable connections with people inside and outside of my major and to make long lasting friendships. Another thing I hope to get out of RIT is job experience and leadership experience.
        Eventually, once I graduate RIT, I hope to be working in the game industry at a relatively well known company.
