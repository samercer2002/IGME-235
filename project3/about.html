    Name: Survive the Hoard<br>
    Concept:
    <p>
        For Project 3, I hope to create an endless horde-shooter where the player tries to survive an onslaught of enemies approaching from four passages into the play-area.
        The passage where the enemies spawn will be random with a random amount of enemies (up to 3) in the passage way. As more time passes, more enemies will start to spawn making it harder for the player to survive.
    </p>
    Platform:
    <p>
        The game will focus on desktop only gameplay due to the control scheme of WSAD for movement and the four arrow keys to shoot in different directions.
    </p>
    Story:
    <p>
        The premise of the game is for the player to last as long as possible against a horde of enemies (probably zombies) in order to survive.
    </p>
    Asthetics:
    <p>
        The graphics will focus on more of a pixelart art style with 8-bit soundfonts. The game will have UI focused around the top of the game screen
        with the player's lives and score. The sounds will be the player firing, the enemies dying and the player losing a life.
    </p>
    Gameplay:
    <p>
        The player will move using WSAD and fire their weapon using the arrow keys that will correlate directly to the direction the player fires.
        Such as the up arrow firing towards the top of the screen, left shooting to the left of the screen, etc. etc.
        Every enemy the player kills will net a positive score amount and the player will start with 3 lives. As the player progresses, they can gain lives after some number
        of enemy kills. The goal of the game is to reach the highest score possible. Losing lives has no negative impact on score, but allows the player to have multiple chances.
    </p>
