        <h2>Goals:</h2>
        The player should try to survive as long as possible given the 3 lives the player has.
        There is an initial set of 5 enemies and after that, sets of 3 enemies will spawn every 4.5 seconds.
        <br><br>
        Occasionally, enemies will drop temporary power-ups that help the player survive longer. If the player has an item already in their inventory, 
        passing over another item will not pick it up. Instead, it will use that item. (items are not currently added yet).
